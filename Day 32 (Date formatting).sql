-- Day 32 (Date formatting)

-- Date formatting is an important aspect of day-to-day data analysis and reporting, it is generally known that date is formatted in different ways depending on the project or reporting task at hand. I was privilege to work on task that require the use of DATE_FORMAT() and TO_CHAR() in date formatting.
-- From the projects, I opted DATE_FORMAT() in some of my project because it offers  customizable date formatting. This function provides flexibility to tailor the date display according to your needs. It's preferred when you need unique or non-standard date formats. Imagine if you want you your date to include hour, month
  DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i') OR
  DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
However, In other project I chose  TO_CHAR() because it ensures consistent date formatting across different databases, making it ideal for projects requiring cross-database compatibility. It ensures uniformity in date presentation, which can be crucial for standardized reporting across platforms.
With any of the formatting you are using, ensure you understand the business case analysis requirement to decide the right function and always test the date formatting in different scenarios to ensure accuracy and consistency.
